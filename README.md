# Embedded Course Modules

The goal of this repository is to be a collection of high-quality open source modules on embedded topics.  For practical exercises, they will use TI's MSP430.

## General Module Format

- Topic
	- General Material on that topic
		- Generally should be video, with notes beneath
	- MSP430-Specific Material on the topic
		- Generally should be video, with notes beneath
	- Brief practical exercise
		- List of steps
		- Solution video

## Modules
- Assembly-to-Machine Conversion
	- Exercise
		- Hand assemble instructions, verify with assembled code
- Debuggers
	- Exercise
- GPIO
	- Exercise
		- Just turning LEDs on and off
		- Maybe reading from another GPIO pin to demo input
- SPI
	- General Material (video)
	- MSP430-Specific Material
	- Exercise
		- Maybe do interal loopback?
- Interrupts
	- Exercise
		- Handling button pushes with interrupts
		- We already know about GPIO, wouldn't be a new concept
- Timer_A
	- Exercise
		- Blink LEDs at an interval
- PWM
	- General Material (video)
	- MSP430-Specific Material
	- Exercise
		- Controlling LED brightness on Launchpad.
- ADC
	- General Material
	- MSP430-Specific Material
	- Exercise
		- Redirect PWM signal to input of ADC?
		- Could use just GPIO but would miss intermediate voltages
